# Lattice-Attacks-on-EC-DSA

# New Bleichenbacher Records: Parallel Implementation
This repository includes the implementation of Lattice Attacks on (EC)DSA, described in the following research paper:

_Chao Sun,Thomas Espitau, Mehdi Tibouchi, and Masayuki Abe, "Guessing Bits: Improved Lattice Attacks on (EC)DSA with Nonce Leakage", to appear at
IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES), 2022/1. 

# How to Run the Script
For example, use the "load" command: load("example.sage")
or use the "attach" command: attach("example.sage")
or directly copy the code into the sage terminal.
Note that in order to use the "load" and "attach" command, check you are in the right path by "pwd".

#standard_lattice_attack.sage
This script implements the typical standard way to perform lattice attacks on (EC)DSA.
